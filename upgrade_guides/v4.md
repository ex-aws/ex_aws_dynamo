# Upgrading from version 3.X.X to version 4.X.X

## Empty string/binary values allowed

In May, 2020, DynamoDB was updated to allow storage of empty strings and binaries in non-key fields - [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/amazon-dynamodb-now-supports-empty-values-for-non-key-string-and-binary-attributes-in-dynamodb-tables/). In earlier versions of this app, fields with empty string attributes were stripped off prior to writing to the DB by `ExAws.Dynamo.Encodable.do_encode/1`; however, in light of these developments, the default behavior of this app will now be to write empty string values. In order to maintain backwards compatibility and to allow users to continue to ignore empty string attributes if they so choose, we provide the config option `:ignore_empty_string_attributes` which may be set to `true` to preserve the legacy behavior - see README for more details.

If you wish to maintain the legacy behavior for your app and continue to avoid writing empty string values to the DB, then we recommend setting `:ignore_empty_string_attributes` to `true` like so:

```elixir
config :ex_aws_dynamo,
  ignore_empty_string_attributes: true
```

Otherwise, please check your application thoroughly and make sure you are prepared for dealing with the possibility of having empty strings in fields that would previously have been returned as `nil` (since, in the past, they wouldn't have been written at all). To be clear, existing records will not be affected; if you wrote a record that has a `nil` value in a string field, that will not suddenly become an empty string when you try to read it; but going forward, if you write a new record with an empty string, that value will be stored as an empty string.
