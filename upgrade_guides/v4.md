# Upgrading from version 3.X.X to version 4.X.X

## Empty string/binary values allowed

In May, 2020, DynamoDB was updated to allow storage of empty strings and binaries in non-key fields - [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/amazon-dynamodb-now-supports-empty-values-for-non-key-string-and-binary-attributes-in-dynamodb-tables/). In earlier versions of this app, fields with empty string attributes were stripped off prior to writing to the DB by `ExAws.Dynamo.Encodable.do_encode/1`; however, in light of these developments, the default behavior of this app will now be to write empty string values.

Please check your application thoroughly and make sure you are prepared for dealing with the possibility of having empty strings in fields that may previously have been expected to return `nil` (since, in the past, they wouldn't have been written at all). To be clear, existing data is not going to be changed - but if, prior to upgrading to version 4, you wrote a record with the values `%{id: "1", optional_string: ""}`, that record will still be returned as `%{id: 1, optional_string: nil}`; if you write a record after upgrading, say `%{id: "2", optional_string: ""}`, that record will be returned exactly as written, `%{id: "2", optional_string: ""}`.
